Interest of content
===

The content wasn't too in depth, which I think is 10/10.
There were some good memes, so for that, I will give them an **Excellent**


Consistency and quality of visual presentation
===
The pages are consistently styled poorly ;(
The home page looks nice, but the rest look like there was no effort to style.
I must give this a **Weak**.

Quality of written presentation
===
For the most part, there are separators and subtitles which makes it easy to read.
Lots of bullet lists make it easy to skim read. I approve **Excellent**.

Validity of HTML
===
The homepage passed a validator with 4 errors and 1 warning.  This is **Excellent**

Evidence of collaboration including
===
The Github insights show a lot of collaboration from most members.
The network shows a lot of merging took place which is even more evidence.
**Exemplary**

Author info not written by the author
===
From the pages I saw, the author description wasn't written by the author.
**Exemplary**

Balanced contributions from members
===
The insights page shows that some members made a lot more commits.
It also shows that the top two contributors 3x more additions than the bottom two.
**Sound**

Not completed at the last minute
===
It's hard to tell because Github doesn't show the contributions over time on a good scale.
But it can be seen 3/5 contributors had decreasing contributions over time, and 2/5 had increasing contributions over time.
I will assume that this means that they did the work at the last moment. **Very good**
